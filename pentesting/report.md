## Peer Attack

### Ian attacking Evan
#### SQL Injection attack
For my attack, I first tried to perform my SQL injection attacks using the update user endpoint. None of my attacks worked. I tried to drop the user, franchise, menu tables. But my attacks only renamed the emails to be things like `fake@jwt.com'; DROP TABLE user; -- `. I expected this exploit to work, but Evan had found it and patched the issue by using SQL parameterization on the query. 

> Code I was trying to exploit
```javascript
if (email) {
    params.push(`email='${email}'`);
}
```

> Evans secure code
```javascript
if (email) {
    params.push(`email=?`);
    values.push(email);
}
```

#### Broken Access Control attack
For this attack, I tried to corrupt and log out users by changing the email address of a known user to to a created user. I thought this exploit was working on my system, but it was likely just a side effect of the previous test. The emails I thought I was changing like `d@jwt.com` probably didn't exist in the database because I had already changed them to `d@jwt.com'; DROP TABLE user; --`, the the email was available in the table. 

Overall it was an unsuccessful (or very successful) penetration test.

## Combined Learning Summary

- AWS is really secure. We didn't find a lot of exploits. Most software that is released commercially, has to be very secure. I think this shows the value of paying for commerical software, it is going to fairly secure and you can not stress over some of the details. 
- Having a really solid method for authentication is critical. From our perspective, the JWT pizza code did a fairly good at securing things. For things like authentication and data, it is a lot safer to pay someone like AWS to handle/store those things. 
- Developing with a security mindset. There are attacks I wasn't aware were possible, and simply just understanding these attacks helps me have clearer picture of how to develop good code.
